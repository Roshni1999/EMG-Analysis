# EMG-Analysis

Experiments conducted as part of Advanced BME Lab (AM5019) during December 2021 & January 2022.

## EXPERIMENT: To analyze surface electromyography (sEMG) signals recorded from the biceps during flexion and extension of the arm while carrying a 3kg load. 

OBJECTIVES: <br/>
To find the RMS amplitude and median frequency for the acquired sEMG signal from the right and left arm biceps:  <br/>
i. With two different electrodes (manufactured by different companies â€“ Medtronic & ESVI)  <br/>
ii. At three different electrode placement separations on the biceps (2cm, 2.5cm, 3cm)  <br/>
